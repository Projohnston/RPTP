# RPTP
Rare Pepe Transfer Protol

This protocol was designed for the use of sharing Rare Pepe's without the prying eyes of those trying to degrade the worth of the pepes.
If you do not wish to use this program for sending rare pepes, use this for sending dank memes.

I have no opinion as to what this program is used for, and you can fork this repository, as long as you credit me and any other contributers.

The Port number will be automatically set to 6969, since it is very unlikely it is already in use, and you may edit the line in Server.cpp.

This is a work in progress as of writing this, so many changes to come.
